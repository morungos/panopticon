Artificial intelligence has a long history. Once the more pressing issues of
the Second War were becoming part of the past, both in the United States and
the UK, different flavours of interest in what was called “artificial
intelligence” in the US, and “machine intelligence” in the UK, started to grow
as an understanding of the potential of electronic computers started to
develop.

Some of the wonderful early work in the field included Chris Strachey’s playful
natural language generation “love letters” at Manchester, written at the time
that Alan Turing worked alongside.

In the United States, the Dartmouth conference — and event

At the time, the gender divide was already growing. The Dartmouth sent only
included men — and at the time, Dartmouth itself was a men-only college.

After this initial ‘Cambrian explosion’ of forms of artificial intelligence,
the field quickly settled into a stable form which largely focused on symbol
manipulation. This was a natural consequence of the field’s early domination by
mathematics, and the influence of the Turing machine concept — computation as
pure symbol manipulation. This symbolic approach to artificial intelligence
grew during the 1960s, fell out of favour in the 1970s, and grew again over the
80s and 90s, before again falling out of favour to be replaced by the more
statistical techniques which now dominate the field.

But this is a naive depiction. And if we look more closely at the field, using
lenses from the social sciences, different patterns emerge.
