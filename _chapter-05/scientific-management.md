In the workplace, the descendant of the panopticon is “scientific management”,
both as originally developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, and in its continued
evolution to this day. The defining features of scientific management are hard
to pin down, but generally it applies a positivist approach to improving
economic efficiency. Taylor identified five main principles:

1. Science, not rule of thumb
2. Harmony, not discord
3. Mental revolution
4. Cooperation, not individualism
5. Development of every person to their greatest efficiency and prosperity

First and foremost, scientific management is about replacing human judgements 
by science. For example, the the early in steel manufacturing industry in the
United States, which was where scientific management was first developed, the
usual method involved detailed analysis of the steps involved in a work task,
and then optimizing to improve the output, maybe in speed and maybe in quality.
“Time and motion studies” were developed independently, but formed a very
natural part of the measurement process.

The common theme is a skepticism of intuitive judgements, and a strong
preference for data-supported alternatives. Scientific management pre-figured
behavioural science (which didn’t exist yet) but as soon that emerged and
started to develop methods for measuring and influencing behaviour, it was a
natural complement.

Scientific management tilts the balance of power somewhat, by increasing the
amount of management influence over the way work is done in detail. Instead of
depending on an individual workers’ skill, management could use workers with a
little less skill and a little more precise control. However, even for Taylor
(despite his clear disdain for unions) efficient work depended on harmony between
management and workers. This often involved transforming the way workers were
paid, including bonuses and performance-related pay.

However, scientific management depended on, and even sharpened, the
distinctions between workers and managers — a distinction that was itself
scientific and could be validated by scientific techniques in hiring.

Although scientific management grew out of industrial work in the UK and the
US, it was highly influential elsewhere, notably in the Soviet Union and in
Japan. Efficiency was at least as important an element in a socialist economy as in
a capitalist one, and Lenin — who had initially been skeptical of American
ideas — ended up endorsing scientific management and its benefits for “lazy”
Russian workers. And in Japan, scientific management again fell on fertile ground, especially
after the Second War destroyed substantial parts of the infrastructure.
