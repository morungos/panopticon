The concept of a “panopticon” was developed by Jeremy Bentham — the same Jeremy
Bentham that founded utilitarianism and who remains to this day preserved as a
somewhat grisly ‘auto-icon’ in University College London.

The idea of the panopticon wasn’t actually Bentham’s, but that of his brother
Samuel, who was a noted architect and engineer, at the time working for the
Russian noble Prince Potemkin. Samuel Bentham had sketched out the core idea: a
circular building, where a large number of workers could be constantly watched
by a few central inspectors at a station in the centre. Jeremy collaborated
with his brother, and further developed the idea into a model for prisons and
other buildings based on the pivotal idea of the “inspection principle”.

Jeremy Bentham put the inspection principle like this:

> “It is obvious that, in all these instances, the more constantly the persons
> to be inspected are under the eyes of the persons who should inspect them, the
> more perfectly will the purpose X of the establishment have been attained.
> Ideal perfection, if that were the object, would require that each person
> should actually be in that predicament, during every instant of time. This
> being impossible, the next thing to be wished for is, that, at every instant,
> seeing reason to believe as much, and not being able to satisfy himself to the
> contrary, he should *conceive* himself to be so” (Bentham, J., original
> emphasis).

And it is worth remembering: a big part of Bentham’s reasoning behind the
panopticon was as a measure to reduce the harms of prisons. First, at the time,
punishment was brutal. Hanging was commonplace, and sending convicts to
Australia was not yet in place.

And the second problem of existing penitentiaries was (and is) corruption. In a
prison, the central visibility means that guards cannot behave with impunity —
at least, not without the complicity of those responsible. As Bentham put it,
“It presents an answer, and that a satisfactory one, to one of the most
puzzling of political questions - *quis custodiet ipsos custodes*?” As such,
Bentham’s promotion of the panopticon prefigures today’s pressure for
transparency.

So what does the panopticon mean? There are several key aspects:

* **Examination**. 

* **Hierarchical observation**. The panopticon design depends on seeing without
  being seen. That is the core inspection principle. In doing that, panopticons divide an
  organization into two groups: a large group of workers who are psychologically
  aware of a constant surveillance; and above them, smaller groups of inspectors
  who are there to govern on behalf of the organization. That principle stands
  today. Note that there is a power difference between these groups: one governs,
  the other is governed. Wherever we see a panopticon, we see this power
  differential.

* **Normalizing judgement**. The third aspect of a panopticon involves making
  judgements a normal part of day-to-day life.

Today, we live in a global panopticon, but a digital one. Our mobile devices
provide data to network providers, telling them where we are at any time.
Google tracks us, but continues to develop technology that means that tracking
is integrated into the browser — their browser. It doesn’t matter what we use
to block cookies or tracking technology, if the browser itself is following us
as we leave our digital footprints around the cybersphere. Advertising might be
the most visible aspect of the new panopticon, but that may only be a
consequence of the fact it’s an aspect that doesn’t give value for most of us.

* Credit scoring companies track every purchase we make, banks and credit card
  companies routinely infer which are likely to be valid, to reduce their risk. 
 
* Loyalty cards track purchases within shopping ecosystems. Air Miles enables
  analytics to determine your daily routines. 
  
* Our mobile devices hop between cellular and wifi networks, both track location 
  in different ways. GPS tracking is a small part of this, but even without that, 
  companies like Apple and Google have address databases that enable them to 
  follow our movements. 

* Device companies like Apple and Microsoft know what software we are using, 
  moment by moment, as well as where we are. 
  
* Digital assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google home are now integrated 
  literally into the fabric of our homes, providing these companies with 
  second-by-second data on the temperature in rooms, when we switch lights on, 
  and so on. 
  
* As an employee, your email will usually be tracked by your employer, depending 
  to some extent on your line of work. In regulated sectors like banking and 
  healthcare, employers have a significant legal duty to monitor for wrongdoing. 
  
* In gig-working companies like Uber, Lyft, and Amazon, employee tracking can be 
  extremely intrusive and aggressive, literally down to measuring bathroom 
  breaks, and automatically firing people who don’t achieve expected productivity 
  standards. 
  
* Your local police department may have an agreement with Amazon to have access 
  to Ring video sources, or other data bought by surveillance companies like 
  Clearview or Palantir, from any of the data sources available. 
  
* Governments, like employers, have some legal responsibilities to track data, 
  but -- especially in some cases -- they may be eager to exceed that.

Forget the Matrix, the digital panopticon exists, and we live in it. We are seen, 
but we cannot see the inspectors.[^1]
