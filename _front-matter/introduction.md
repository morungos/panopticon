This book has two distinct purposes. First, it uses the concepts and the
methods of the social sciences to explore the way that the modern world is
increasingly becoming to resemble a digital Panopticon. It analyses the ways
that Bentham’s original concept has flowed through industrialization and
scientific management, through the advent of digital computing, the internet,
and ubiquitous wireless communications, into the world as we know it today.

But there is a second purpose to this text. The new Panopticon, like Rome,
wasn’t built in a day. It was assembled, piece by piece, by people who did so,
sometimes with the best of intentions, and sometimes, maybe, with touches of
self-interest and carelessness. What we think of as ethics is, in large
measure, the decision-making process that we apply as we put these pieces
together. We cannot always see the big picture as we build. We need stories,
methods, and tools, which we can use to help guide our decisions. Maybe, if we
understand the impacts of our actions a little better, we can establish a
slightly better trajectory, and maybe we can avoid some of the mistakes we have
made.

In calling this “The New Panopticon”, let’s remember that we are (well, at this
point, maybe just I am, as I have yet to lay out the full case) consciously
making a value judgement about the way that technology treats us in the modern
world. Historically, of course, Bentham did not consider the Panopticon a bad
thing. Considering the era and the way prisons worked at the time, he
genuinely, and with good reason, thought it would make things significantly
better for everyone, inmates and warders alike. Like Bentham, we need to remember that our values are
essential to a social science understanding of the digital world. The idea that
we can be — or should be — in any sense ‘objective’ about these things is
simply wrong. It is wrong in science too (as Dewey observed) but it is
especially wrong in the social sciences. There is no value-free social science.
If we pretend to be impartial about crime, poverty, discrimination, or
prejudice, all we are doing is enabling them to persist.

And yet, we cannot be naive about this. We can’t simply decide that a
Panopticon (or any other technical innovation intended to improve society) is a
Good Thing or a Bad Thing, then use it or discard it accordingly. We have a
responsibility to understand, to consider what we do, and to use our insights
and our judgements to make sure that the pieces we contribute to society are,
generally, going to make a positive difference rather than a negative one.

Of course, we may disagree about the details. In the following pages, as well
as Bentham, you will meet people like Karl Marx and Henry Ford, as well as the
founders of Juicero, Theranos, and Uber. Some of them make it pretty hard to agree
with them, for different reasons. But for one, I hope you will listen to their
views and think about them, before making your own decisions. But make them
*your decisions*, nobody else’s.

The world we live in today, for the most part, is very different to the early
1800s, both socially and technologically. Bentham was seeing those changes as
they happened. The industrial revolution had already built up a significant
head of steam, but communications and transport was still the realm of boats
and horses, electric power was unknown, and ‘democracy’ (such as it did exist)
was limited to land-owning men over the age of 21, and was almost entirely
absent in the new industrializing cities. And yet, the social problems of
Bentham’s time — poverty, crime, corruption, class conflict — are recognizably the social
problems of today.
