In one sense, alternative forms of currency are nothing new. At the beginning
of the industrial revolution, there was a significant shortage of small
denomination coins — the sizes that were needed to pay workers. This was
particularly true in the industrializing North of England — the government did
not distribute pennies outside London, and even stopped making them in 1775.

As a result, employers began to make their own “token” coins, which could then
be accepted and traded in the local community. Possibly the best-known example
is that of the Parys Mountain mining company, based on Ynys Môn (in English:
Anglesey), at the time the largest copper mine in Europe. They minted about 200
tons of pennies (“Druids” — due to the picture of a druid on one side) over
about thirty years.

Eventually, mechanization caught up with minting coins, and the new steam power
technology transformed the process, and a new generation of copper coins
started to appear in 1789, with tokens becoming illegal as currency in the
1820s.

But the idea of an alternative currency, one existing outside government
regulation — and even designed to compensate for the disadvantages of
government — was not over!

With the advent of the internet, international borders started to call, and
currency was no exception. Except, that is, for governments. Each country had
its own currency, and sending money between countries involved either suitcases
or international banks, both with significant costs or risks. There was an
opening for a way to send money between countries electronically.

The first mainstream step in this was perhaps PayPal.
