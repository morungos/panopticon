title: 'Perverse incentives and the cobra effect'
order: 50
---

Legend has it that in India, during British rule, there was a time when the
land was overrun by cobras. As a solution, they developed the ingenious idea of
putting a bounty on each dead cobra. It worked at first, as many dead cobras
were handed over. However, over time, the British discovered that the number of
actual live cobras wasn’t falling as they had planned. Because each dead cobra was
worth a substantial reward, it was now more cost-effective to breed cobras and
turn in their scaly little corpses for money. What had started out with the
become a large-scale cobra-farming programme.

There are far more egregious cases of this kind of perverse incentive. In
Canada **when?**{: .todo}, the government paid 70 cents to 
support orphans, but $2.25 to support
those with mental illness, and under the Quebec administration of Maurice
Duplessis, thousands of orphans were deliberately mis-certified to increase
revenue for the hospitals.

There is a general principle underlying these cases: Campbell’s Law[^1], which
states:

> “The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making,
> the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be
> to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.”
> (Campbell, 1979).

The point is that incentives modify behaviour, but not necessarily in the way
that you plan. And the higher the stakes, the more likely everything is to get
out of whack.

This is a serious problem. Under George W. Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” and
continuing with Obama’s “Race To The Top” education ‘reforms’, childrens’
scores on standardized assessment tests became dramatically more important, in
some cases even directly linked to pay for teachers. The consequence was,
primarily, a dramatically increased focus on coaching for these tests — to the
point that lunch breaks were reduced to seven minutes in some cases, and even
foods were adapted to finger food, to allow coaching to continue through the
breaks. Although this did improve scores on these standardized tests, it harmed
the quality of education.

There’s an important lesson in these stories: society changes, but not in a way
that is easy to predict. Technological innovations are particularly
unpredictable. They have a constant habit of developing side-uses that then
overtake the main purpose. Some examples:

* SMS messages — these originated from paging devices, small, cheap,
  receive-only machines that were relatively common the 1980s, before cellular
  phones were truly affordable.

* GPS - designed originally for the US military... **complete**{: .todo}

* The World Wide Web — perhaps most dramatically, the World Wide Web was
  originally conceived as a publishing system. When forms were added, it started
  to change, and today it has morphed into a full communication platform, with
  even peer-to-peer aspects. Its impact has been so dramatic, that it has
  arguably swallowed the internet itself, and replaced many of the older
  protocols.

Joseph Schumpeter called this “the gale of creative destruction” — there is no
‘stable’ economy, everything is constantly mutating and transforming, older
economic structures are destroyed, and new ones created.

In entrepreneurship, creative destruction is often seen as a good thing, even
as an explicit goal. Instead of starting an insurance company, people will set 
out to 'disrupt' the insurance industry, essentially, to find  way to rewrite
the economics in a way that will strengthen their economic position.

Many of the successes of technology enterprise in the last few decades followed
this playbook. Uber and Lyft disrupted the taxi industry. Amazon disrupted retail. 
Robinhood and Wealthsimple disrupted investment. 

But there is a common pattern here.

* Technology. First, these compares are technology companies, and they use 
  automation extensively to reduce the company's costs, throughout the entire process. 
  Note that this is not necessarily the same as reducing the consumer's costs. 

* Regulation. Second, in many cases, these industries are regulated, sometimes
  heavily. This may limit a company's ability to either gain entry to the market, 
  or to do so in a cost-effective way. Uber's approach to the taxi industry is
  an excellent example. By framing themselves, at first, as a marketplace to enable
  ride-sharing, they used a loophole. It didn't even need to work everywhere, but in 
  enough places to build up the financial resources to then use lawyers and lobbying
  to spread. And all these years later, it's now clear that they were never really a
  ridesharing marketplace, they were attempting to rewrite the rules of the taxi 
  industry.

    Similar concepts are also expressed in Goodhart’s Law and the Lucas
    critique. In fact, Lucas’s version is perhaps even more directly relevant to
    data science, as it states that historical data, especially when aggregated, is
    not a useful guide to future behaviour. This is directly applicable to machine
    learning, in the sense that historical data sets cannot be a useful guide to
    how people will behave in practice.
