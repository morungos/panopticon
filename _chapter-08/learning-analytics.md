Unlike most companies, in one sense Google still behaves very much like a startup: it is still searching for product market fit. Where most companies have at least some product focus, Google will simply generate hundreds or even thousands of products and then see what sticks. Much of the time, these products get cancelled after a few years, but it’s still work looking at what...

One of the areas Google has consistently — even relentlessly — pursued, is education.

In this, they are far from alone. Apple, for example, has long been an innovator in education. Its profoundly influential ‘Classroom of Tomorrow’ explored how technology could participate in education, but certainly at the time, Apple was far more interested in using this as promotional material to sell hardware, not to provide services. 

Artificial intelligence has long been linked with education, and in particular educational technology. 

* Intelligent tutoring systems. Developed in the 1970s and 1980s, the basic principle is to use artificial intelligence and a model of a learner, to adapt teaching materials and coach learners through their personal learning journey.
* Assessment. Another area where artificial intelligence has a long record is in automating the grading process. E-rater, developed by ETS, claimed to have a similar accuracy to human graders, at least for short texts of a hundred words or so.[^1] E-rater used latent semantic analysis, an early version of word embeddings. 
* Learning analytics. A more recent innovation drew more from big data analytics, and depended much less on a model of a learner, although data about each learner was still an issue. Learning analytics is very much within the spirit of the modern panopticon.

“Learning analytics is the collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their interactions with their learning environment, for the purpose of better understanding learning, optimizing learning environments, and improving learning outcomes”

This is entirely consistent with Bentham’s “inspection principle”: learning analytics is the inspection lodge, made real, within learning environments.

In education, ethics is a very significant issue. For example, the […] uses neural sensors to detect activity, essentially measuring attention to track the learning process. 

The EU has now specified that educational assessment is in its ‘high risk’ category, so any development or innovation in that area requires a more detailed plan and process. 

As Seely Brown and Duguid pointed out, educational organizations have not one, but two distinct purposes: first, teaching; and second, certification. These correspond roughly to learning and assessment. Assessment is exactly the kind of thing that fits perfectly with panopticism — it is, after all, normalizing judgement. And examinations in the Western world (they were, after all, invented in China) became widespread

And there is good reason for this. At the time, the assessment process in universities was fatally flawed — they were more like exhibitions than examinations.

Common Schools — as developed by Mann — were partly panoptical, but not entirely so, omitting the asymmetric visibility of the inspection lodge.
